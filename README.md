ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lucashervier a young Data Scientist Researcher at [IRT Saint-Exupery](https://www.irt-saintexupery.com/) in Toulouse 
## Professional Interest ðŸ‘€
Iâ€™m interested in Machine Learning, Evolutionary Algorithm, Reinforcement Learning and Video Games.
At present I am dealing with the question of Explainability and Fairness in AI!
## Activities ðŸ’¼
Iâ€™m currently part of the DEpendable and Explainable Learning [(DEEL)](https://www.deel.ai/) Project which is
involved in the development of dependable, robust, explainable and certifiable artificial intelligence technological
bricks applied to critical systems.

Especially, I worked (and keep working) on the [Xplique](https://deel-ai.github.io/xplique/) library which is an Explainability Toolbox
based on TensorFlow! If you are interested in XAI, I recommend you to have a look!
